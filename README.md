# multi-agent-pathing
# Summary
This repository contains a 2-Dimensional pathing simulation and renderer for designing and analyzing path finding algorithms.
The objective is to build up from single agent pathing into examining more complex multi-agent path-finding
algorithms.


# Setup
To install all the repository requirements:  
``` pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Running
To run the current simulation runner (likely to change):  
```python simulation_test.py```


# Samples
The image below shows two agents path planning around an obstacle.
